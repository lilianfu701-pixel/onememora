 * Crawler policy.
 *
 * The disallow list is a courtesy, not a control: a crawler that ignores it
 * still gets nothing, because each of these paths refuses the request itself.
 * `/admin` in particular answers 404 to anyone who is not staff, so listing it
 * here does not disclose a way in.
 *
 * Individual memorials are not listed. Whether one may be indexed depends on
 * what its family chose, which is expressed per page through `noindex` and
 * through the sitemap, not through a pattern that would have to enumerate them.
