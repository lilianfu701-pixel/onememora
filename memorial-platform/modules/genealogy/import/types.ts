/**
 * Source-agnostic contracts for importing genealogy into the platform.
 *
 * A dataset is the shape every source normalizes to: a flat list of people,
 * each with a stable id within that source, plus a list of relations between
 * those ids. An adapter for Wikidata, CBDB, a 族谱 book or a hand-authored
 * fixture all produce the same {@link GenealogyDataset}; the importer downstream
 * neither knows nor cares which one it came from.
 *
 * The normalized shape is deliberately smaller than what a memorial can hold.
 * A source is trusted for identity and lineage — a name, rough dates, who a
 * person's parents and spouse were, and a citation for all of it — and nothing
 * more. Biography, media and the finer record are left for a claiming family to
 * add, so an import seeds a page without pretending to author a life.
