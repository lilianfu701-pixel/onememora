/**
 * Canonical offering catalogue.
 *
 * The four offering kinds a visitor can leave. Prices and display durations are
 * fixed here rather than read from a CMS: they are a product decision, not a
 * per-memorial setting. `createOffering` lazily ensures each product row exists
 * from this table, so the altar works whether or not the seed has run.
 *
 * Durations follow the product brief: incense is a passing gesture (one day), a
 * candle burns for a fortnight, a wreath stands for a season. A donation never
 * expires from the merit book — it is a gift recorded, not a decoration shown.
